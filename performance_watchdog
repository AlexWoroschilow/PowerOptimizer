# Also consider merely using a larger value for the commit option. This defines how often changed data is written to the disk (it is cached until then).
# The default value is 5 seconds.
# See man mount(8) for details on how the rel/noatime and commit options work.
# Use laptop_mode to reduce disk usage by delaying and grouping writes. You should enable it, at least while on battery.
